<p>Identification of the pest, comprehending its biology and seasonal population trends, destructive life phases and their environments, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life phase for several control choices, host choice and alternate hosts, predictability of pest occurrence based upon the environment, cropping trends, farming practices, and other influencing elements, and all the associated details is vital for determining an efficient control strategy.</p>
