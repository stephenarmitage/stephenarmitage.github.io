<p>Termites are such destructive pests that you desire your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. When action, identification, and tracking limits suggest that pest control is needed, and preventive methods are no longer effective or readily available, IPM programs then evaluate the correct control approach both for efficiency and threat.
