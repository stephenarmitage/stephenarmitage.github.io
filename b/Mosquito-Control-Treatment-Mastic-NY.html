All employee should be informed as to the value of the IPPM program and be motivated to send samples of insects found throughout the center to the IPPM committee.</p>
<p>Biological control techniques can also be viewed as natural solutions as they do not count on the use of pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is essential due to the fact that rodents and insects bring diseases, infest your cooking areas and bedrooms, and bite you or your family pets.
