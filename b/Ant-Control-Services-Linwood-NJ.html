We ensure that our highly trained exterminators are able and very experienced to deliver the very best possible pest removal services in Dimapur.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which enabled local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will make sure favourable economic condition, eco-friendly and social consequences 13 and applies to a lot of agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management program. But by concentrating on non-chemical alternatives initially, you can make sure that your pest management program is effectively getting rid of pests at the least risk to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
