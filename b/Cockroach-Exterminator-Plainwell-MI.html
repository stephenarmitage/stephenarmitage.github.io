A technique that involves the use of pest-resistant and pest-tolerant cultivars established through conventional breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars possess physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's beauty or suitability for the pest to feed, establish, or recreate effectively.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove because growers were not ready for such an intercropping plan. If your facility presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>

When distributed in the field or placed in traps, baits containing dangerous product will draw in and kill the pests.</p>
<p>However by following standard avoidance suggestions and using pesticides moderately when needed, you will likely be fine.
