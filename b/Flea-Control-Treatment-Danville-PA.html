Insecticides are classified in a number of methods, and it is necessary to be familiar with these classifications so that the option of an insecticide is based on more than simply how well it manages the pest.</p>
<p>Biological pest control measures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes initial task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control specialists even fix structural damage brought on by termites.</p>

Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect species or life stages. </p>
