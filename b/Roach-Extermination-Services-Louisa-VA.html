I have been dealing with Animal & Pest Pest Management for many years; I state "with" due to the fact that it has actually been a true collaboration in servicing the requirements of the communities I handle. The chemical insecticides are utilized in a manner that is least disruptive to biological control.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been frequently utilizing much of these IPM techniques for years or perhaps generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations vulnerable to pests, or utilizing tolerant or resistant varieties. Sovereign Pest Control and its affiliated companies provide quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 house owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee. </p>
