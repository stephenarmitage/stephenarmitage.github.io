For instance, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the probability that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses a lot of the very same concepts as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides. </p>
