With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a environmentally benign and cost-effective  pest control method ideally suited for both little and large farmers around the world. Once termites have actually entered a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be considered as a decision-making process in which observations (from assessment and tracking) are utilized to make pest control choices based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
