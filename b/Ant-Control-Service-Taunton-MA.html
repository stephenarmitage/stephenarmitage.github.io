Think about alternative techniques (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure.

If your center presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
