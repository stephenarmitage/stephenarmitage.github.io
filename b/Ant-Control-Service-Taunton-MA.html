<p>Regrettably, the higher Tampa Bay area is house to plenty of spiders, and you have most likely come across them inside your home. Think about alternative techniques (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure.

<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al.

If your center presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
