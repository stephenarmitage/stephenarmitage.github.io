<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, handle, and reduce threat from pests and pest management tools and methods in a way that decreases total financial, health, and ecological dangers.</p>
<p>We provide fast, efficient and safe pest control options. Pest control employees must be in good health, because of the physical demands of the task, and they also must be able to withstand unpleasant conditions-- such as the heat of climbing into an attic in the summer or the chill of sliding into a crawlspace throughout winter. Tolerance of pests varies according to the health danger (low tolerance) or merely a cosmetic damage (high tolerance in a non-commercial scenario). </p>
<p>The lots of differing threats from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections. In these countries, routine use of pesticides is restricted to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly centered on cotton, soybean, rice, and sugarcane.</p>
