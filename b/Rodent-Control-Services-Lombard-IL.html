<p>Think about alternative approaches (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from ending up being an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building.
