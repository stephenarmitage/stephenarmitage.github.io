<p>The determination of the proper reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect types or life phases.</p>
