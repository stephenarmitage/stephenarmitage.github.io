You are free to spend that time doing other crucial things when you employ a pest control company. In the last few years, pest control has actually ended up being more technically included, with licencing and restrictions on chemicals," Dr. Siddiqi says.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as an entire and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is normally used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
