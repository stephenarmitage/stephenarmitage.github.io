<p>Do not keep too many plants or haphazard packages of documents as dampness and cellulose bring in termites. I have actually been dealing with Animal & Insect Pest Management for several years; I state "with" due to the fact that it has actually been a true partnership in servicing the needs of the neighborhoods I manage. The chemical insecticides are utilized in a way that is least disruptive to biological control.</p>

Select a pesticide that is pest particular, if available; keep in mind, do not kill the advantageous insects.
