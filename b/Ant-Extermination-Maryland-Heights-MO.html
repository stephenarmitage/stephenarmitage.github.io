D's has been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control along with fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 types of insects, spiders, and mites have established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the type of a solid, liquid, powder or spray.
