	<meta name="description" content="Pest Control Industry in Edgewater NJ - Organic food systems employ similar methods but limit the use of pesticides produced from non-natural” or synthetic sources (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency US-EPA, 2014 2 ). Worldwide, chemical pesticides have played a vital role in providing an abundant and inexpensive food source (US-EPA, 2015 3 ). Despite an increase in food production, however, the persistent overuse of chemicals has resulted in a number of adverse environmental impacts such as, outbreak of secondary pests, decreasing of beneficial insects and the accumulation of toxins in the food webs ( Arora et al., 2014 ). Continued research and development of sustainable and effective agricultural-pest-management techniques is essential if farmers are going to successfully adopt environmentally friendly pest-management strategies ( Pretty and Bharucha, 2015 ).">
