<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is usually used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has actually been successfully used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
