A single finding of any pest in a warehouse throughout an audit can imply a lot of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your belongings with hazardous chemicals, ruin the air quality in your home or business, possibly infect food and other perishables, and just kills pests at the surface area of the problem.</p>
