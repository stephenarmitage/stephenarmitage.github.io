This technique describes the use of a variety of mechanical or physical strategies for pest exemption, trapping (in many cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

Using physical traps to control pests is potentially the most recognisable pest control procedures.</p>
<p>There are lots of agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests.
