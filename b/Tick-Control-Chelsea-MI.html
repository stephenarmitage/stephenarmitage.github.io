Our groups of professional Pest Control Technicians welcome the IPM technique to pest control and are able to provide service to fulfill the pest management needs of any commercial or residential customer.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and considers a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of incorporating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to welcome collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance. </p>
<p>IPM supplies an effective method for managing pests in all arenas from developed farming, residential, and public lands to natural and wilderness locations. Our termite control services will treat and safeguard your home from any more damage.
