<p>Biological pest control procedures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even repair structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>Concurrently, it is also based upon semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are warded off or deterred away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide problems are triggered by a small number of the pesticides available today.</p>
<p>The decision to utilize an insecticide, or take some other action, versus an insect invasion needs an understanding of the level of damage or insect problem a crop can tolerate without an inappropriate economic loss.
