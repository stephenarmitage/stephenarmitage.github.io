<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community method to crop production and security that combines various management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and decrease using pesticides. For instance, if you're not sure whether you have carpenter ants or termites, get help recognizing the pest from your local extension service or exterminator. General pest control supplies you complete protection from the pests that currently populate your house as well as from the pests that might get into in the future.

IPM collaborates using pest biology, ecological details, and offered technology to prevent undesirable levels of pest damage by the most affordable ways, while lessening risk to people, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>If, after following organized and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use chosen biopesticides with low environmental effect.

Reliable, permanent corrective actions can then be required to prevent pests from entering the structure and infesting the building and collections.</p>

<p>Extremely impressed with the professional approach of Sunlight Pest Control team, my house was terribly harmed by termite but they have actually done very good job and they were extremely courteous.
