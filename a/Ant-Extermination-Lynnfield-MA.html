<p>Fifty 7 of 66 broad spectrum pesticides utilized on rice at the time were banned by governmental decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach foundation and the four components of management, aspects that affect rewarding, safe, and budget friendly food production at a larger scale and their implications for global food security must likewise be included in an IPM model.</p>

Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
