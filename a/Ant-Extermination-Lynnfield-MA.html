<p>Fifty 7 of 66 broad spectrum pesticides utilized on rice at the time were banned by governmental decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach foundation and the four components of management, aspects that affect rewarding, safe, and budget friendly food production at a larger scale and their implications for global food security must likewise be included in an IPM model.</p>
