<p>People who do not have chemical, biological and electronic methods of controlling a pest population will often count on physical approaches. One Time Treatments, Quarterly, & Monthly Providers. Alternatively, treatment services supplied more often than three times per year are not required with top quality products used by expert professionals. Trap cropping: Two crops of same family like cabbage; cauliflower, cotton, okra can be grown together and after attack of pest small crop is eliminated which is trap crop.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like spiders, ants, or roaches, we will determine the source of the issue.
