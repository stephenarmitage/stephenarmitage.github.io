<p>People who do not have chemical, biological and electronic methods of controlling a pest population will often count on physical approaches. One Time Treatments, Quarterly, & Monthly Providers. Alternatively, treatment services supplied more often than three times per year are not required with top quality products used by expert professionals. Trap cropping: Two crops of same family like cabbage; cauliflower, cotton, okra can be grown together and after attack of pest small crop is eliminated which is trap crop.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like spiders, ants, or roaches, we will determine the source of the issue. The objective is to provide an overall understanding of the concepts of IPM, together with the concepts for application in all crops.
