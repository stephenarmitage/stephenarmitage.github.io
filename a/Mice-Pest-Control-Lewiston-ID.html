IPM holds that erasing an entire pest population is frequently difficult, and the attempt can be ecologically risky and pricey.

<p>To ensure least effect of our pest treatments on environments, we utilize products that cause least effect on the environment.

For instance, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the probability that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). A lot of pesticide problems are brought on by a little number of the pesticides available today. </p>
