An IPM scout can be the grower, a worker, an expert specialist or pest control consultant.

<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, handle, and reduce risk from pests and pest management tools and methods in a way that minimizes general financial, health, and ecological dangers.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies a lot of the very same ideas as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
<p>Typically, the main goal of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally developed for farming pest management, IPM programs are now established to encompass illness, weeds, and other pests that may disrupt the management goals of sites such as residential and commercial structures, lawn and grass areas, and home and community gardens.</p>
