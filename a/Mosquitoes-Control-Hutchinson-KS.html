<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a cost-effective and environmentally benign pest control technique preferably matched for both small and large farmers around the world. When termites have actually entered a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from evaluation and tracking) are used to make pest control choices based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been routinely using a number of these IPM methods for decades and even generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations prone to pests, or using tolerant or resistant varieties. Sovereign Pest Control and its affiliated companies provide quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 property owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee. </p>

Thoroughly keep an eye on fields for all pests to identify the need for restorative insecticide treatments. Now long term effective pest control is readily available on your fingertips.</p>
