<p>The idea of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for handling pests, has actually remained in practice for a long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Freezer is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their advancement and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>Pest control is an extremely important measure owing to the reality that a number of pests are providers of hazardous disease-causing microorganisms. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the elimination of a couple of pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).

<p>Kids are specifically prone to harm from pesticides, because their bodies and body immune systems are still developing. The Asia Pacific is forecasted to be the fastest-growing region from 2017 to 2023 due to the stringent requirement for business facilities and commercial sectors (such as food processing, food service markets, and tourist sectors) to abide by pest control regulations within their premises.</p>
