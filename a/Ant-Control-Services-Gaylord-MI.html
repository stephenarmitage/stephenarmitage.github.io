<p>During multiple outreach meetings and field trips arranged solely for the general public in Southern California throughout the past few years, it appeared that a bulk was not aware of farming systems, had misunderstanding about sustainable farming, and believed that organic food is pesticide-free (Dara individual observations and unpublished study data).</p>
<p>Remove or cover bird cages and aquarium, and move other family pets prior to utilizing aerosol (spray) pesticides. Make certain the person who will be using your pesticides holds a valid photo ID Pest Control Licence. Consumers should inform the pest exterminators about the specific infestations prior to the treatment or at the time of reservation. Planting potatoes well away from the previous year's crop avoids access to needed food and the beetles will starve.</p>
