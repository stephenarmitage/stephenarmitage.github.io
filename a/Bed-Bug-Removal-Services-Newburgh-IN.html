<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, hence triggering enormous damage within just a few months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to client houses and companies to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes introducing natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a brand-new area where native natural opponents do not provide control.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted local farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will ensure beneficial economic condition, social and ecological consequences 13 and is applicable to most farming, public health and amenity pest management situations.</p>
