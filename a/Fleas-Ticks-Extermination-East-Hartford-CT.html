<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been recommended as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove since growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your facility presently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact services and products.</p>
<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, gardening, forestry, human habitations, preventive preservation and basic pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and ornamental pest management. Deal with a pest problem with a hand sprayer, fertilize your lawn with a granular spreader, tackle termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait gun, or apply pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>
