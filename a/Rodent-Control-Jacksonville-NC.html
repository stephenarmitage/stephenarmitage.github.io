<p>The most effective strategy for controlling pests is to integrate techniques in an approach referred to as Integrated Pest Management (IPM). A normal mistake most businesses run into is describing their business name too literally by using overused pest control terms like control, insecticide, pesticide, and management.

Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are typically found pests in our society.</p>
