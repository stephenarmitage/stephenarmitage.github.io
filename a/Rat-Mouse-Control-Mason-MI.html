<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly specifically about minimizing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management techniques are unable to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Instead, call HiCare and have our specialists check your houses for white ants and termites. And vice versa, pest management professionals can use video to record and tell evaluations and leave a copy for the facility supervisor via e-mail, or carry out a real-time video co-inspection with the customer if they are unable to be present at their center throughout the examination.</p>
