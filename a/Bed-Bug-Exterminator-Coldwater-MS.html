Use of high yielding ranges, extensive farming practices, high dosages of fertilizers and chemical pesticide brought idea of modernization in farming.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest issues, classical biological control method is typically utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
