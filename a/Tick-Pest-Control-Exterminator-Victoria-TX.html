<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ).

The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
