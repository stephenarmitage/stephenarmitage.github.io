<p>This physical control puts an instant end to pests' plant-damaging days. Pesticides not included in baits or traps must usually only be used to targeted locations, not sprayed over the entire space. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a philosophy that includes the management of a pest rather of managing or removing a pest. TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl spaces, and specially engineered weather condition removing for garage and entry doors not just deter rodents and other destructive pests from getting in and living in your house, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
