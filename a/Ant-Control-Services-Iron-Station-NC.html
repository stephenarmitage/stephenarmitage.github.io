Integrated pest management (IPM) is a system of securing crops that fulfills the requirements of sustainable advancement by allowing farmers to handle pests in a way that is economical, ecologically sound and ideal to embrace under local conditions.</p>
<p>For instance, rodents threaten grain snails, birds and yields damage strawberries, potato beetles attack eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes. In addition to pest control, we likewise use integrated strategies to help secure the whole house, including insulation and moisture control services. IPM is generally focused on establishing systems based on biological and non-chemical approaches as much as possible.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies a number of the very same concepts as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
<p>Normally, the main goal of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now established to include diseases, weeds, and other pests that might hinder the management goals of sites such as residential and business structures, yard and turf areas, and home and community gardens.</p>
