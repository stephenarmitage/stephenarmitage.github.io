The service received (Cockroach control) was really timely and professional. Early detection of diseases and pests leads to timely action when pest or illness levels are low and actions most reliable. These pests also carry harmful bacteria and diseases on their bodies that can be sent to people who come into contact with their droppings, urine and infected surfaces or products.</p>
