<p>Therefore IPM is best combination of all possible methods in pest management with least reliance on chemical pesticide. Management decisions ought to be based upon tracking and population levels of insect pests, in addition to trustworthy limits. IPM addresses all the economic, ecological, and social elements and offers economical and safe food to the revenues and consumers to producers and sellers, while keeping environmental health.</p>
<p>In West Africa, the use of okra as a trap crop reveals rewarding results in fighting bollworms and other cotton pests. There was a great deal of termite problem I was dealing with previously and with this service I had the ability to control termite to a fantastic extend. Hoffmann, M.P. and Frodsham, A.C. (1993) Natural Enemies of Vegetable Insect Pests. Three disciplines, Biological Control, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and Biotechnology, have actually attained particular importance in our quest for much better pest control strategies.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and thinks about a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>We presently do not provide pest control services for houses. Rather, the pest control specialist should concentrate on the food handling and vending locations, making use of bait applications rather than spraying. They incorporate cultural, biological, mechanical, chemical and physical practices to handle pests. Utilizing physical traps to control pests is possibly the most recognisable pest control measures. </p>
