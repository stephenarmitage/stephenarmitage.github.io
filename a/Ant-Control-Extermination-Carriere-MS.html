D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>

Our pest control company is so much more than an exterminating service company, we're your Family, Friends, & Neighbors.</p>
