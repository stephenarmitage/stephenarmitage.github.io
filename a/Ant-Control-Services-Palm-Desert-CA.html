<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" developed over a period of about 10 years, primarily amongst scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are often monocultures, consisting of a single crop types, which creates a homogenous habitat frequently doing not have key requirements of natural opponents, therefore preferring pest species.</p>
<p>Destruction of crop residue: Pupae of insect remains inside the crop residue and can be controlled by damaging it.

<p>Action Pest Control offers comprehensive bed bug control services including examinations performed by highly trained bed bug pets and bed bug heat treatments administered by expert bed bug professionals. With more policies on pesticide use and a reduction in the variety of active components in some crops, there is a greater focus on better understanding of available control alternatives (Hillocks 2012 ). Regulatory standards that restrict the use of particular pesticides or promote making use of others can have a major impact on IPM implementation.</p>
<p>Biological Control: Utilizing helpful animals such as insects or fungi that damage the weeds. Less emphasis is put on how natural enemies function and how we can promote their natural effectiveness. Consider soil or substrate health not only in the biological sense: very little existence of soil borne diseases or pests. Our integrated pest management services are known for offering safe, efficient and long-lasting outcomes. </p>
